    <p>Yogurt is fairly to make at home and the result is much better in flavor and consistency than most commercial yogurt. You'll save money making your own,
       and also be able to choose what doesn't go into your yogurt (commercial brands often include thickeners and other non dairy ingredients)</p><br>
    <h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3> 
    <ul>
       <li>1 quart/liter milk</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Steps to make it</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently heat the milk over medium low heat until it reaches 180<sup>o</sup>F/82<sup>o</sup>C. Turn of the heat and the milk cool down to between 106<sup>o</sup>F/41<sup>o</sup>C and 110<sup>o</sup>F/43<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
        <li>While the heated milk is coolong, wash the jars and leave them filled with hot water so the glass will be warm when you add the yogurt.</li>
        <li>When the milk has cooled enough, warm a large bowl or measuring cup by filling it with hot water. Empty out the water. Strain the milk through a fine
            mesh strainer into the warmed bowl. Whisk in the yogurt. pour out the water in the jars and pour in the milk plus yogurt mixture. Fasten the lids</li>
        <li>Be careful not to jostle the jars while the actice yogurt cultures are working on the milk. yogurt is very finicky about this, and will sometimes not set up well
            if the jars are moved during this period</li>        
        <li>Transfer the jars to the refrigerator</li>    
        
    </ol>
